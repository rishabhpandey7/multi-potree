* This is a multi-pointcloud viewer based on Potree, which is a free open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/) and research projects [Harvest4D](https://harvest4d.org/), [GCD Doctoral College](https://gcd.tuwien.ac.at/) and [Superhumans](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Superhumans/).
* Newest information and work in progress is usually available on [twitter](https://twitter.com/m_schuetz)
* Reference: [Potree: Rendering Large Point Clouds in Web Browsers


# Getting Started

### Install

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

Install dependencies, as specified in package.json, and create a build in ./build/potree.

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

Use the `npm start` command to 

* create ./build/potree 
* watch for changes to the source code and automatically create a new build on change
* start a web server at localhost:1234. 

Go to http://localhost:1234/examples/ to test the examples.

### Convert Point Clouds to Potree Format

Download [PotreeConverter](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter) and run it like this:

    ./PotreeConverter.exe C:/pointclouds/data.las -o C:/pointclouds/data_converted

Copy the converted directory into &lt;potreeDirectory&gt;/pointclouds/data_converted. Then, duplicate and rename one of the examples and modify the path in the html file to your own point cloud.

* The multi-res-octree algorithms used by this viewer were developed at the Vienna University of Technology by Michael Wimmer and Claus Scheiblauer as part of the [Scanopy Project](http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/).
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), the WebGL 3D rendering library on which potree is built.
* [plas.io](http://plas.io/) point cloud viewer. LAS and LAZ support have been taken from the laslaz.js implementation of plas.io. Thanks to [Uday Verma](https://twitter.com/udaykverma) and [Howard Butler](https://twitter.com/howardbutler) for this!
